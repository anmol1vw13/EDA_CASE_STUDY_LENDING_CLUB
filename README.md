# Lending Club Case Study

Lending Club, a marketplace focused on consumer finance catering primarily to urban customers, encounters a pivotal obstacle in managing its loan approval system. In assessing loan applications, the company must make prudent choices to minimize financial setbacks, particularly arising from loans granted to individuals deemed as high-risk.

These financial setbacks, known as credit losses, materialize when borrowers fail to meet their repayment obligations or default altogether. In simpler terms, borrowers categorized as "charged-off" represent the main source of significant losses for the company.

The main aim of this endeavor is to aid Lending Club in alleviating credit losses, which stem from two potential scenarios:

1. It is imperative to identify applicants with a high likelihood of repaying their loans, as they contribute to the company's profitability through interest payments. Declining such applicants would mean missing out on potential business opportunities.
2. Conversely, approving loans for applicants with a low likelihood of repayment and at risk of default could result in substantial financial losses for the company.

## General Information

The aim is to identify potential loan defaulters, thereby reducing credit losses. This study endeavors to achieve this objective through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the provided [dataset](./loan.csv).

The company seeks to comprehend the key factors influencing loan defaults, i.e., the variables strongly indicative of default. This understanding can aid the company in portfolio management and risk assessment.

The main goal of this exercise is to aid Lending Club in minimizing credit losses. This challenge arises from two possible scenarios:

1. It is crucial to identify applicants with a high likelihood of loan repayment, as they can contribute to the company's profits through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants could lead to missed business opportunities.
2. Conversely, approving loans for applicants unlikely to repay and at risk of default can result in significant financial losses for the company.

## Conclusions

- Positive Growth Trend: Capitalizing on the steady increase in loan applicants from 2007 to 2011 can be achieved by maintaining competitiveness in the industry while strengthening risk management practices.

- Seasonal Trends: Anticipating increased demand during peak periods like December and Q4 ensures efficient processing to meet customer needs.

- Verification Process: Improving the verification process to effectively assess applicant creditworthiness can enhance loan performance.

- Housing Status and Default Risk: Evaluating housing stability for applicants living in rented or mortgaged houses aids in assessing repayment ability.

- Term Length: Evaluating risks associated with longer-term loans and adjusting interest rates accordingly helps manage default probabilities.

- Geographic Risk: Monitoring regional risk trends and adjusting lending strategies or rates accordingly in high-risk areas such as California (CA), Florida (FL), and New York (NY) is crucial.

- Subgrades B3, B4, and B5: Offering additional risk mitigation measures or lower loan amounts to applicants with these subgrades can reduce default risks.

- Risk Assessment for Grades B, C, and D: Implementing stricter risk assessment and underwriting criteria for applicants in Grades B, C, and D can help mitigate default risks.

- Debt Consolidation Risk: Carefully evaluating applicants seeking debt consolidation loans and potentially adjusting interest rates or offering financial counseling services is essential.

- Experience and Default Probability: Using a comprehensive credit scoring system that considers other risk-related attributes beyond experience alone is necessary to assess creditworthiness accurately.

- High Loan Amounts: Conducting thorough assessments for larger loan requests and potentially capping loan amounts for higher-risk applicants can mitigate default risks.

- DTI and Interest Rates: Reviewing the interest rate determination process and adjusting rates based on DTI ratios to align with the borrower's ability to repay is important.

- Low Annual Income: Offering financial education resources or setting maximum loan amounts based on income levels ensures affordability for borrowers with annual incomes less than $40,000.
